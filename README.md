## 🎯 **About the Monty Hall Problem**

The Monty Hall problem is a fascinating probability puzzle rooted in game theory, named after the host of *"Let's Make a Deal"*. Here’s how it works:

1. **Three doors**: Behind one door is a car (prize), and behind the other two are goats.
2. **Your choice**: You pick one door (e.g., Door 1).
3. **The reveal**: The host, Monty Hall, opens another door (e.g., Door 3) to reveal a goat.
4. **The decision**: Stick with your original choice or switch to the remaining door.

**What should you do?** Switching doors statistically improves your chances of winning to 2/3, while sticking leaves you with a 1/3 chance.
