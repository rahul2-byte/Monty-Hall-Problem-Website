## üéØ About the Monty Hall Problem

The Monty Hall problem is a counterintuitive probability puzzle named after the host of the American TV game show, *"Let's Make a Deal"*. Here's how it works:

1. You are presented with three doors. Behind one is a car (the prize), and behind the other two are goats.
2. You pick a door, say Door 1.
3. The host, Monty Hall, who knows what‚Äôs behind each door, opens another door, say Door 3, revealing a goat.
4. You are then given the choice to stick with your original pick or switch to the other unopened door.

**Question**: Should you stick or switch to maximize your chances of winning?

**Answer**: Switching doors gives you a 2/3 chance of winning, while sticking to your original choice gives you a 1/3 chance.
